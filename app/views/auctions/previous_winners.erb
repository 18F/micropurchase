      <p>All micro-purchase auctions are for open source code contributions to public code repositories (repos) hosted on GitHub. Auction winners submit code to a repository for review, and if the code passes the acceptance criteria, the owner of the repository will accept the code into the repository. On the left, you can see a breakdown of the various repos that have incorporated code from micro-purchase auction winners. On the right, you can see what programming languages have been used in micro-purchase solutions. Move your mouse over a section to see the name of that category.</p>

      <p>The micro-purchase platform has tapped into an interested community of both government product owners and open source contributors. As the 18F team ramps up capacity to host more auctions for more projects, we’re also seeing an increase in bidders. This is all positive evidence that there is an untapped marketplace for small, open source contributions to government projects. Drag and adjust the black box on the bottom bar to see a more detailed view of each date.</p>
