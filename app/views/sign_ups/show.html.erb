      None of the content in this GitHub repository is considered proprietary or
      procurement-sensitive information. Furthermore, all users who submit bids
      consent to the publication of their GitHub usernames, DUNS numbers, and bid
      amounts following the conclusion of the bidding process. Bidders’ email
      addresses will not be disclosed and will only be used for
      micro-purchase-related communication on an as-needed basis.

      In order to bid, all users must be listed as “Active” in SAM.gov on the day the
      auction opens. The process for SAM.gov activation may take several days, and we
      encourage interested vendors to sign up at least one week prior to bidding. To
      check your status with SAM.gov, you may use the SAM Status Tracker. If you need
      help with SAM.gov, call the toll-free SAM.gov Help Desk: 1-866-606-8220.

      This platform is the primary method of bidding on micro-purchase opportunities.

      micro-purchase platform and on GitHub, as well as associated with each vendor
      and the vendor’s DUNS number. Furthermore, vendors may register as either
      individuals or businesses on SAM.gov. Please file a GitHub issue in this repo
      if you have any questions.
