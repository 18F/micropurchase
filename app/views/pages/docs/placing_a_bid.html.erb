  <h1>Placing a Bid</h1>

  <p class="usa-font-lead">Before you can place a bid you'll need to request a
  DUNS number and register on SAM.gov. Then you'll need to link those accounts
  to your 18F Micro-purchase account.</p>

  <h2 id="request-a-duns-number">Request a DUNS number</h2>

  <p>Start by <a href="http://www.dnb.com/duns-number/lookup.html">looking up
    your DUNS number</a> on the Dun &amp; Bradstreet website. If you've worked
  with the government in the past, you may already have one.</p>

  <p>If you don't yet have a DUNS number, you can start by <a
    href="https://www.dandb.com/product/companyupdate/companyupdateHome?execution=e10s1">creating
    a Dun &amp; Bradstreet business profile</a>. You will need to use a browser
  other than Google Chrome, as the Dun &amp; Bradstreet website does not
  currently support it. Once you've created a business profile, your DUNS number
  (and marketing materials, see below) will be sent to the contact information
  you specify within 30 days after your profile is created.</p>

  <p>Please be aware that "as a result of obtaining a DUNS number, you [will] be
  included on D&amp;B's marketing list that is sold to other companies. If you
  do not want your name/entity included on this marketing list, you must contact
  D&amp;B â€¦ to request removal." (<a

  Our team is really sorry about this. It's <a
    href="https://github.com/18F/micropurchase/issues/1090">an issue we're aware
    of</a> and looking into.</p>

  <h2 id="register-on-sam-gov">Register on SAM.gov</h2>

  <p>Once you have your DUNS number, <a href="https://www.sam.gov">visit
    SAM.gov</a> and create an individual account. The process is demonstrated in
  the video, below. Note that while registration physically takes about an hour,
  it can actually take <strong>about a day or two</strong> for the your
  application to be processed and for your information to propagate across
  various systems.</p>

  <p>Be sure to link your DUNS number with your SAM.gov profile. Also, please
  note that auctions with a starting bid of $3,500 or more are only available to
  <a
    href="https://www.sba.gov/blogs/how-and-why-determine-if-your-business-small">small
    businesses</a>. If you're a small business, please ensure your Sam.gov
  profile correctly reflects this.</p>

  <h2 id="sign-up-or-complete-an-existing-profile">Sign-up or complete an existing profile</h2>

  <p>Once you have a Sam.gov account, you can either <a
    href="/micropurchase/sign-up">create a new 18F Micro-purchase account (using
    GitHub)</a> or you can link your SAM.gov account with your existing 18F
  Micro-purchase account.</p>

  <p>18F Micro-purchase uses your DUNS number to verify your registration on
  SAM.gov. To initiate this verification, <a href="/micropurchase/profile">visit
    your profile</a> and update your DUNS number. The verification process
  should take no longer than a hour or so. Once you're verified,  you're ready
  to bid.</p>

  <h2 id="place-a-bid">Place a bid</h2>

  <p>To place a bid, simply find an open auction by visiting the 18F
  Micro-purchase homepage. Once you've identified an auction on which you'd like
  to bid, visit the auction description page and look for the auction's status
  box. If you're eligible to bid, you'll see a form that looks like this:</p>

  <figure class="figure-2">
    <%= image_tag('place_a_bid_example', alt: 'bid box example') %>
  </figure>

  <p>Enter a number less than the maximum bid (or current bid, if the auction's
  bids are not sealed) and click "Place bid". Good luck!</p>
