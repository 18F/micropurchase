  <h1>Getting Paid</h1>

  <p class="usa-font-lead">18F Micro-purchase gives vendors the flexibility to
  choose the payment processor that works best for them. All we need is a place
  to enter our credit card information. This is known as a vendor's
  <strong>Payment URL.</strong></p>

 <p>To specify or update your Payment URL, simply <%= link_to 'visit your
   profile', profile_path %>. We'll issue payment at your Payment URL whenever you win an
 auction and meet its acceptance criteria before the delivery deadline. Please
 note that if you use a payment processor that charges us a fee, that fee will
 be deducted from the award.</p>

  <p>PS: One payment processor we've seen used is <a
  href="https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/tutorial">Stripe</a>. Stripe is simple
to setup, and doesn't charge a fee for those issuing payment. What's more, one
vendor actually wrote an open source app to <a
  href="https://github.com/cwarden/pay">deploy a Stripe payment form via
  Heroku</a>.</p>

  <p>PPS: Oh, please also <%= mail_to 'micropurchase@gsa.gov', 'let us know' %> if
you're interested in using PayPal.</p>
