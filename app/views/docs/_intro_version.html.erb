  <p>From <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/13/open-source-micropurchasing/">"Open
  Source Micro-purchasing: An experiment in federal acquisition"</a>:

  <blockquote>18F is an open-source team. We currently have hundreds
  of publicly available repositories, with dozens under active
  development. We've had numerous contributions from colleagues within
  government, and contributions from members of the public. But in the
  next few weeks, we are going to run an experiment: we want to
  contract for contributions. And we want to do it the 18F way.

  Part of contracting the 18F way is ensuring that all systems are
  built modularly and with APIs as capable as the human interface. The
  micro-purchase platform itself is no exception. This means that all
  data and transactions that are accessible via the web UI can be
  accessed by software using the API.

  <p>This documentation for using the API assumes you have some
  experience with writing clients for RESTful APIs, although for some
  situations you can just use <a href="">curl</a> or <a href="">jq</a>
  to get the information you need.</p>

  <h2 id="version">Current Version</h2>

  <p>This documentation is generated from
  the <a href="<%= @swagger.base_path %>/swagger.json">API's
  specification file</a>, written
  in <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>. This file can be used to
  validate API responses and to automatically generate client
  libraries. We have not verified that auto-generated clients function
  correctly, but
  please <a href="https://github.com/18F/micropurchase/issues/new)">file
  an issue</a> if you try it and it works (or doesn't).</p>

  <p>The current version of the API is <%= @swagger.info.version %></p>

  <p>All requests to the API use a base path that includes a version
  string. The base path for the current version of the API
  is <code><%= @swagger.base_path %></code> and this should be
  prepended to all requests.</p>

  <p>When a new version is introduced, all methods of the prior
  version will be deprecated and after a few months, the endpoints of
  the previous version will be removed. It is your responsibility to
  update your code for the latest version.</p>
