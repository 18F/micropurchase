  control_key: AC-2   # Account Management
  narrative:
    - text: >
        Within our application (see cloud.gov for lower-level controls),
        Contract Officer user accounts are created and managed by a data
        administrator. Authentication is provided by cloud.gov's User
        Account and Authentication (UAA) server, while authorization is
        provided by the Django application; if a data administrator
        hasn't explicitly created a user account for an individual and
        associated it with the same government-issued email address that they
        log in to cloud.gov with, the user is denied access to all parts
        of the site requiring login.

  control_key: AC-3   # Access Enforcement
  narrative:
    - text: >
        Information about approved price list data is meant to be accessed
        by the general public. Submitted price lists that have not yet
        been reviewed, or which have been rejected, are visible only to
        data administrators and the Contract Officers who uploaded them.

  control_key: AC-6   # Least Privilege
  narrative:
    - text: >
        At the application level (see cloud.gov for lower-level controls),
        only data administrators have the ability to modify approved price
        list data. Any data modifications made by Contract Officers must be
        reviewed by a data administrator before they can be made available to
        the general public.

  narrative:
    - text: >
        Cloud.gov logs requests, failures, warnings, etc. emitted by the
        application. We also utilize New Relic, which registers Python-level
        exceptions and periods of down-time.

        In addition to the low-level reporting provided by cloud.gov, New Relic
        sends email alerts to the team after repeated errors or down-time.

  narrative:

        In addition to cloud.gov controls, all code is reviewed on GitHub before
        being merged into the "master" branch. These changes are tested
        automatically via Travis CI (which runs unit, integration tests, and
        static analysis) as well as manual testing for visual regressions.
        Proposed changes have appropriate justification (describing problems
        resolved or referencing further details in an issue tracker) in either
        their commit history or as part of the GitHub Pull Request. Proposed
        changes which fail automated tests are generally not merged. Only the
        tested, "master" branch code is deployed, on an ad-hoc basis.

  control_key: CM-6   # Configuration Settings
  narrative:
    - text: >
        As described in README.md and deploy.md, configurable settings are
        defined in a handful of locations. Configuration for cloud.gov
        environments is located in the manifests directory and
        hourglass/settings.py. Configurations which are
        specific to one cloud.gov environment (i.e. either the staging or
        production environment) are located in the appropriate manifest-*.yml
        file or stored in and provided by a cloud.gov "user provided
        service".

        (Gemfile), as well as a listing of relevant cloud.gov services

  narrative:
    - text: >
        In addition to cloud.gov controls, the application layer is scanned with
        both static and dynamic tooling. Before being merged into "develop" and
        "master", all custom code is automatically analyzed by Brakeman
        (static code analysis of Rails apps for known security vulnerabilities),
        and a handful of custom, security-centric unit tests.
        Code which does not meet these standards is generally not
        merged. We also employ Gemnasium to track our dependencies and
        Code Climate to warn of potentially concerning style.

        For static analysis, we've addressed all critical issues raised by
        evaluating the application with OWASP ZAP.

        At the application layer (see cloud.gov controls for lower), one
        selection criteria for libraries was their support status. Should a
        library fall in to an unsupported state, 18F has the capacity to
        maintain it in-house.

        Production errors are captured via New Relic and emailed to
        relevant parties. Further, code is first deployed (automatically) to
        our staging environment, where we may discover errors before appearing
        in production.
