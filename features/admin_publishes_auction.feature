Feature: Admin publishes auction in the admin panel
  As an admin
  I should be able to publish auctions

  Scenario: Auction is C2 approved and uses default purchase card
    Given I am an administrator
    And I sign in
    And there is an unpublished auction
    And the auction is for the default purchase card
    And the c2 proposal for the auction is approved
    When I visit the admin form for that auction
    Then I should be able to set the auction to published

  Scenario: Auction is not C2 approved and uses default purchase card
    Given I am an administrator
    And I sign in
    And there is an unpublished auction
    And the auction is for the default purchase card
    And the c2 proposal for the auction is not approved
    When I visit the admin form for that auction
    Then I should not be able to set the auction to published

  Scenario: Auction does not use default purchase card
    Given I am an administrator
    And I sign in
    And there is an unpublished auction
    And the auction is for a different purchase card
    When I visit the admin form for that auction
    Then I should be able to set the auction to published

  Scenario: Admin creates and publishes auction with other purchase card
    Given I am an administrator
    And there is a client account to bill to
    And there is a skill in the system
    When I sign in
    And I visit the auctions admin page
    When I click on the add auction link
    And I fill auction form with choosing "other" purchase card
    Then I should see that the auction type is sealed bid
    And I click to create an auction
    Then I should see the auction's title

    When I click on the auction's title
    Then I should see the start time I set for the auction
    And I should see the end time I set for the auction
