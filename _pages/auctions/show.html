        <p class="issue-description p-summary">Open Opportunities uses the open source sails.js MVC framework (Node.js / Express). Currently, a task creator should receive the following notification if a task they created receives a comment. However, this functionality has broken, without breaking the build's test suite. This issue sees the creation of a failing test (or tests) that will only pass when the notification functionality is restored, along with the fix to make those tests pass.</p>
