# MPT3500

This app will be used to manage bids for 18F's [micro-purchase threshold experiment](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/13/open-source-micropurchasing/). Vendors will be able to view open issues and bid on them, given they have GitHub accounts and are registered on [SAM.gov](https://www.sam.gov).

This is a Ruby/Sinatra application using Active Record and PostgreSQL. Start the app using `rackup`. Run tests using `rspec`.
